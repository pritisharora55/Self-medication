# Self-Medication


Self medication is harmful for us to a certain extent. As some diseases are not assessed properly and undertaking medicines might create more of a harmful effect for us. It might not be fatal in the present but in the long run, it surely disrupts our normal cycle. Antibiotics taken without the recommended course surely has a negative effect on the immnunity of the body. Moreover, it becomes less effective in the future if not followed in a particular course. Moreover, there might be underlying damage which might go unassessed. Frequent pains in a certain part are not healthy signs but taking a pill everytime  it comes up will surely have bad repurcussions on our body. This doesn't sound like a deadly problem but it surely grasps us one way or another.
